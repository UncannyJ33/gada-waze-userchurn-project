    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Distributions:\n",
    "Most behavioral variables are right‑skewed, with many users showing relatively low activity and a smaller group exhibiting extremely high usage (sessions, drives, distance, and duration). A few variables, such as `n_days_after_onboarding`, are closer to uniform, indicating that both new and long‑tenure users are well represented in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data quality:\n",
    "Overall, the dataset appears reliable, but `driven_km_drives` contains physically improbable values and derived metrics like `km_per_driving_day` initially produced infinite values when dividing by zero driving days. The mismatch between high values of `driving_days` and `activity_days` raises questions about measurement windows and user behavior that are worth clarifying with Waze.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Churn breakdown:\n",
    "Roughly 17–18% of users churned, while 82–83% were retained, and this churn rate is consistent across iPhone and Android users.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Behavioral drivers of churn:\n",
    "Users who drive very long distances per driving day are more likely to churn, while those who drive more frequently (more driving days) are less likely to churn, suggesting that frequency of use signals retention, whereas long‑distance, high‑intensity driving may relate to different situational or behavioral churn factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Engagement patterns and tenure:\n",
    "Half of users record 40% or more of their lifetime sessions in the last month, despite a median tenure of nearly five years, and these highly active users span the full tenure range. This indicates recent surges in activity across cohorts, not just among new users, and is a key point to investigate further with the Waze team.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Open questions:\n",
    "The EDA raises several questions for future analysis: what drives missing churn labels; who are the extreme “super‑drivers”; why do retained users sometimes have fewer drives than churned users; and how product or environmental changes might explain sudden increases in recent usage. These questions guide the next steps in statistical testing and predictive modeling.\n"
